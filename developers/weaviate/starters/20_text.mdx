## Overview

This page will show you how to use Weaviate with text data. In this guide, we will use a Wikipedia article as an example, and show you how to build a Weaviate database, ingest the data as well as to query it with Weaviate.

We will cover:

- [Configuring Weaviate](#configuring-weaviate) to work with text data
- [Creating a collection (class)](#creating-a-collection-class) of text objects
- [Adding text objects](#adding-objects-to-weaviate) to Weaviate
- [Searching for text objects](#searching-text-objects) in Weaviate

Building on from the [Quickstart tutorial](../quickstart/index.md), we will:

- Cover more of the options in depth, and
- Point you to various resources where appropriate.

:::tip Prerequisites
If you haven't already, please complete the [Quickstart tutorial](../quickstart/index.md) before you work through this guide.

<!-- ## Key considerations

For using Weaviate with text data, the following considerations may be important. We will cover each of these as we progress in this guide.

### Vectorization

- Will you use Weaviate or bring your own vectors?
- If you use Weaviate, what module and model will you use?

### Base content

- What parts of the text will be vectorized?
- E.g.: Will you vectorize the whole text, or just the title?

### Data structure

- How will the text be structured?
    - Will you use a single text property, or multiple fields?
    - How will each text property be tokenized?

### Search

- How will you search the text?
- What quantum of text do you want to retrieve? -->


## Building a text database with Weaviate

### How to run Weaviate

For this guide, we recommend that you run Weaviate through WCS. This will allow you to get started quickly, and to focus on the text-specific aspects of Weaviate with an inference-API vectorizer.

:::info Alternatives
- Any of other [installation options](../installation/index.md) are also suitable.
- If you want to vectorize data locally using `text2vec-transformers`, you can use the [Docker-compose installation](../installation/docker-compose.md) or [Embedded Weaviate](../installation/embedded.md).
:::

### Which vectorizer to use?

As you saw in the Quickstart, you can ask Weaviate to vectorize data at object creation or import time, or you can bring your own vectors.

In this guide, we will use a Weaviate vectorizer module to vectorize text data.

Weaviate modules for vectorizing text data are called `text2vec` modules. We will use `text2vec-cohere` in this guide. This module uses the [Cohere API](https://cohere.ai/) to generate vectors for text data.

:::info Alternatives
You can use any `text2vec` modules instead.

<br/>
<details>
  <summary>How do I do that?</summary>


You can choose any module as appropriate for your use case.
<br/>

Some of them, such as `text2vec-huggingface`, `text2vec-cohere` or `text2vec-openai`, generate vectors through an external API. Others, such as `text2vec-transformers`, or `text2vec-contextionary`, generate vectors locally.
<br/>

For example, you can use `text2vec-transformers` to generate vectors locally. If doing so, replace settings as appropriate where you see `text2vec-cohere`.
<br/>

To check what modules are available in your Weaviate instance, you can run:


<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
client.get_meta()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If your preferred module is not enabled, you can enable modules through the respective configuration means, such as `docker-compose.yaml` for Docker-based deployment. See the respective [installation guide](../installation/index.md) for details.

</details>

:::

### Create a collection (class)

Next, you should def
ine a collection (class) for your text objects. In the class definition, you can specify:
- The metadata for your class and properties, and
- Their behaviors and settings, such as vectorization and indexing settings.

For this guide, we will use the following class definition:

```json
{

}
```
