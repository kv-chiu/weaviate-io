This page provides an overview of the different use cases of [vector datases](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) alongside some open-source demo projects, you can fork and modify.

If you would like to contribute your demo to this gallery, connect with us on [Slack](https://weaviate.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-230mg7ofo-k__CuUfA0nXtQJYEL80_Pw#/shared-invite/email) or the [community forum](https://forum.weaviate.io/).

:::info
During October 1-31, 2023, we are hosting a community sprint to onboard engineers and machine learning practitioners to their first open source contribution.

Demos that are marked with a pumpkin üéÉ sign are looking for contributions.

## Similarity search

The original use case of vector databases is for search. Vector searches can be performed on and across any modalities, such as text or images, or their combinations. Because a vector database can help find similar objects,they are also used in recommendation systems in classical machine learning applications as a restated task of search.

## LLMs and search

Because vector databases can address some of Large language models (LLMs) limitations, such as hallucinations, by acting as an external knowledge database, vector databases and LLMs go together like cookies and milk.

## Classification

A vector database like Weaviate understands the context of concepts, which allows automatic, real-time classification of unseen, new concepts. For example, a flight ticket from an airline needs to be classified as "international travel" but this is often not done correctly, not done at all or not done in a way that it works for a specific business question (e.g., an airline ticket classified as "international travel" can't answer the question "How much money has been spent on non-ground travel"). Because Weaviate knows what "international travel" and "air travel" means, airline tickets can automatically be classified as "travel expenses" or "flight tickets", and "national travel" or "international travel".

|Title | Category | Modality | Code | Demo |

| üéÉ Audio Genre Classification | Classify the music genre of an audio file. | Image | [code](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/audio-genre-classification) | n/a |

## Other use cases

Weaviate's [modular ecosystem](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules) unlocks many other use cases of the Weaviate vector database, such as [Named Entity Recogniction](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/ner-transformers) or [spell checking](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/other-modules/spellcheck).
