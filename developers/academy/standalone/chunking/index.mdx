Chunking is often an essential part of dealing with long texts. This goes for both vector search and generative search - for slightly different reasons.

This unit covers this seemingly simple, but nuanced topic from the perspective of a user. We'll begin by covering what chunking is, and why it has become necessary, even though the existence of long texts is certainly not new.

We'll then move on to cover various chunking methods before discussing key considerations when deciding on a chunking strategy, as well as some suggested starting points.

By the end of this unit, you will have a good understanding of chunking in general, and be able to implement some solid chunking strategies based on your actual needs.
